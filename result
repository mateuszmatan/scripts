in JKS files I have such errors:
"filePath":  "C:\\certs\\ta.jks (alias: verisign class 1 public primary certification authority)",
"error":  "Exception calling \".ctor\" with \"1\" argument(s): \"Cannot find the requested object.\r\n\"",

in p7c and single cert files I have such errors:
Processing: C:\certs2\zs5.p7c
Error Found:
     File:  C:\certs2\zs5.p7c
     Error: Exception calling ".ctor" with "1" argument(s): "Cannot find the original signer.
"
